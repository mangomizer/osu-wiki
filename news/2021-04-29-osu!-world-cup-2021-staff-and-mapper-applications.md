Similar to last year we have multiple open positions for people to apply to. A few forms have been updated and revised, namely the Mappool Selector and the Mapper Application forms!

## osu! World Cup 2021

### Mappool Selector

Mappool selectors are often underappreciated, but here we recognise the value of experienced insight and acumen that go towards shaping the mappools.

We are looking for individuals who, in addition to being able to quickly and critically evaluate key skillsets of maps, are also open to discussing and exploring new ideas through lengthy discourse.

The responsibility and commitment is heavy for this role, but if you feel you have what it takes to be a mappool selector, then [Apply here](https://forms.gle/wRZbUw8ysSkC7JrN9)!

### Mapper for custom OWC maps

If the mappool selectors form the backbone of a tournament, then the custom mappers surely are its muscle.

In the past year custom mapping has taken community tournaments by storm, and the osu! World Cup will continue to uphold the highest standards in supporting mappers with this process. This year features a more specific application form with various slot descriptions to make it easier to apply as a mapper and get a feel for the broad skillsets a mappool needs.

Mappers can expect to be contacted between late May and November.

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/BYhDbVz4PZjzAaDv6) if you are interested in helping out as a custom mapper!

### Commentator/Referee

Last but certainly not least, commentators and referees operate at the face of the tournament, and aim to provide a great live viewing experience for all.

Required availability is between October and November.

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/NjVXUKZ16AgwJCwN9) if you are interested in helping out either as a referee or a commentator!
